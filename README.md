#### We aim to accomplist the following for this study:

    *Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:

    *Build a prediction model that will perform the following:

      *Classify if a customer is going to churn or not
      *Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low     hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn
